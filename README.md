# GKK Records rendering using Svelte
Live at https://gkk-styrkelyft.se/rekord/

This is my first attempt at using Svelte. Any notes about best practices I've missed or other ideas are welcome.

## How to build
1) Clone repository
2) Install depencecies, `npm install`
3) Build, preferably using `npm run dev` which also sets up a dev-server at `localhost:5000``

The file `public/test.html` uses the package in the intended environment, which adds a few additional styles.
